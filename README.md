# Personal Site

This site was created from HTML, CSS, and some JS/jQuery scripts. The floating astronaut landing page design is something I came up with one day. Anyways, I'm hoping to upload way more projects from now on, and update the site as I go.

UPDATE (7/17/20): I figured out how to reroute a subdomain to a different branch so I can start working on a blog. Figuring a design and building it will be tougher than the current homepage. I'll keep trying.

UPDATE (12/20/20): Little tidying up since I finally have time.

UPDATE (7/10/21) :  this domain is about to expire i don't really know what my next plans are yet, prob gonna nuke this repo and start a new one.
