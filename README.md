# Personal Site

This site was created from just HTML, CSS, and some JS/jQuery scripts. I spent most of the time trying to figure out a layout that wasn't hideous, had good spacing, and would work as a responsive design (curse the tablets). The floating astronaut landing page design is something I came up with one day. I don't know why or how, but I think it looks decent. Anyways, I'm hoping to upload way more projects from now on, and update the site as I go.
